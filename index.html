			</br><strong>Welcome to my page!!!</strong> My name is Phat Tran and I am currently an international student majoring in computer science at Florida State University. I started studying abroad at the Spring semester during my sophomore year in high school. Studying abroad gave me lots of opportunities to grow and learn to adapt to new culture.
			</br>
			</br>During my studying abroad time, I lived with a host family during my high school life that is very welcoming and I considered them as my second family here in the United States. I find myself to be very lucky because I got 2 families that fully support what I love and want to do in life.
			</br>
			</br>I have lots of hobbies besides school. I usually go online and learn about different area in the technology world and try to create something that can be useful for the world. I also love to help the community around me especially helping other students so I sign up for lots of mentoring and tutoring opportunities that are available. My other hobbies include organizing events,performing, reading, working out, practicing martial arts and beatboxing.
